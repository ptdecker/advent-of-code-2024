# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

To run a solution to a puzzle, use the just receipt (assuming you have just installed):

```shell
just day01part1
```

Receipts are also provided to run the solution against the example puzzle data given in each puzzle description:

```shell
just day01part1example
```

The data provided to me for my puzzles can be found in `./data`. The answer to a given puzzle can be found in
the top source code comments for a given solution. 

Common data types, helper functions, etc., are in a [common library](lib/src/lib.rs).

* Day One
    * [Part One](day01part1/README.md) ([source](day01part1/src/main.rs))
    * [Part Two](day01part1/README.md) ([source](day01part2/src/main.rs))
