# Day 2 Part 1: Red-Nosed Reports

This is my solution to day two, part one, of the 2024 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. Per
the request of the sponsor, [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/), the puzzle text should not included in external repositories.
Nor should the individualized input data. If you work through the puzzles yourself, the puzzle text is progressively
revealed and you'll receive your own input data which will generate an answer just for you.
